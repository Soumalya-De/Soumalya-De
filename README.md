# 👋 Hey, I’m Soumalya De

For over 15 years, I worked with solopreneurs, startups, SMEs, and global brands like Kia, Castrol, and SBI—helping them find their authentic voice and tell stories that truly resonate.

In 2023, mid-conversation with a startup founder, I caught myself saying:  
*"Imagine if we could just build this instead of pitching it."*  
That moment changed everything.

So, I took the leap:  
- Enrolled in a Bachelor’s in Computer Applications (BCA) with no tech background—just curiosity and a hunch.  
- Started learning coding, data structures, OS, and networking—at 37—and fell in love.  

This isn’t a career switch; it’s a remix. I didn’t leave branding behind—I layered tech on top.

## 🔧 What I’m Exploring  
- 🐍 Python (can’t get enough)  
- 🛡️ Cybersecurity (exciting and intense)  
- 🧠 AI & Machine Learning fundamentals (mind officially blown)  
- 🛠️ Weekend projects turning “what if?” into “it works!”

## 🧪 Projects I’m Building  
- A career chatbot for non-tech folks exploring tech roles  
- A QR scam detector to flag shady payment links  
- A currency converter Chrome extension (API + browser testing)  
- And whatever curiosity drags me in next!

## 📌 What I’m Looking For  
- Internships, full-time roles, or freelance gigs in AI, cybersecurity, or impactful tech  
- Teams solving real-world problems  
- Mentors who laugh when I say, “Wait… arrays are just lists?”

If you’re building something that needs a translator between humans and tech, let’s chat.  
I bring:  
- A marketer’s obsession with the “why”  
- A new coder’s wide-eyed curiosity  
- And 15 years of getting people to care — now about tools, not taglines.

**P.S.** If you’ve ever Googled “what even is an API?” or whispered “I think I can build this…” — I’m right there with you.
